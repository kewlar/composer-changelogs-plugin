Composer Changelogs Plugin
==========================

Whenever you do `composer update` or `composer install` this plugin displays links to GitHub's "Compare Changes" pages for 
each updated package, so you would have an easier time checking what's actually changed, e.g.
```
$ composer install
Loading composer repositories with package information
